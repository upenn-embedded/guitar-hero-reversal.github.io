## Final Project Proposal

### 1. Abstract

Our project repurposes an old toy guitar controller into an embedded music-learning device. The controller’s buttons will be programmable and mapped to individual notes or chords, while the strum bar will trigger sound generation. The sound will be produced by a synthesizer that we will design and build, and features like a mute button, whammy stick, and small display will make the device more expressive and customizable.

### 2. Motivation

Our motivation for choosing this project is that it combines hardware reuse with a meaningful educational application. Rather than leaving an obsolete gaming peripheral unused, we saw an opportunity to redesign it into a low-cost and engaging platform for teaching fundamental music concepts such as notes, chords, and pitch variation. The main problem we are trying to solve is that beginner music tools are often either too limited, too expensive, or not very interactive. By reusing an existing guitar controller and pairing it with a custom-built synthesizer, we can create a more hands-on and accessible way for users to learn basic musical ideas. This project is interesting because it combines embedded systems, digital sound generation, and interface design, while also showing how outdated electronics can be transformed into practical and creative learning tools.

**This is the end of the Project Proposal section. The remaining sections will be filled out based on the milestone schedule.**

## Sprint Review #1

### Last week's progress

We took apart the original guitar and tested each interface button, stick and switch with a multimeter to make sure current flowed through them and they were functional. We decided to pivot from an analog synthesizer to a digital synthesizer that operates off of code, and created the first draft of this code for our intial test. We also noticed that the main board which we'd be replacing in the guitar did not fit properly with the internals, so we created a CAD model of the board to laser cut a new one with more leeway in the measurements for the openings to make it slot in seamlessly.

### Current state of project

We're still waiting on the remainder of our parts to come in so we can assmeble the system, flash the code and run our intial tests, but for now we've decided to pivot our strategy from connecting only through jumper wires to instead running connections through copper tape on our new iteration of the internal board, as per our team manager's suggestion.

### Next week's plan

Build the first full working version of the guitar, test the existing code and mke changes as needed, then begin adding LCD screen functionality.

## Sprint Review #2

### Last week's progress

We built a breadboarded prototype of the system with the parts available in detkin since our ADC and a few other Adafruit parts still hadn't come in. We had to make a few code changes to account for the difference in functionality due to the lack of an ADC but eventually got decent sound output as desired, then wired up the LCD display though it still isn't functional and doesn't correspond to notes/inputs like we want it to.

### Current state of project

We have a working prototype and are considering using the same no-ADC method in our MVP to reduce complexity and get a full built working version as soon as possible.

### Next week's plan

Print the main master board and solder the system using the wiring format we've used in our prototype and fit it to the actual guitar, fix the LCD screen to at least show some response to inputs even if it isn't fully functional yet.
